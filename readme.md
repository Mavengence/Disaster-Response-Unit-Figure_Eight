## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks, Presentation and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/Mavengence/Kaggle-Seattle-Airbnb-Analysis.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Of course you need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report or the presentation by ur self u need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and maybe an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.
- Get the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) from Kaggle.com

### Instructions for execution
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up the database and model.

    - To run the ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores the data in the database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run the Machine Learning and NLP pipeline that trains the classifier and saves it as pickle file
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
